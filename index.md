**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic so far has been Deep Bayesian Active Learning (DBAL). DBAL is a methodology for minimizing the training data required for an adequate model. For us, this means we are able to train a surrogate model on data from a much more expensive simulator.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

For quarter 2, I would like to investigate implementing batch active learning, via Google Cloud. This would require both modifying the training script we have in place, as well as building a cloud infrastructure for the task.

**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

In quarter 1, we spent a lot of time learning about the Google Cloud Platform, as our project is much more in infrastructure building, rather than novel coding. For me, this meant creating a lot of minimal functioning tests and demos, which are not something that I want to carry on to quarter 2. In quarter 2, I hope to create and structure my code in a much more permanent fashion.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I would be highly interested in databasing techniques to help the overall infrastructure of our training scheme as well as make important data, such as effects of different policy changes, more publically available and easily attainable.
